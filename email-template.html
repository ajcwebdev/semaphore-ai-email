                    <h3>Why you should write your own LLM benchmarks — with Nicholas Carlini, Google DeepMind</h3>
                    <p>The article features an interview with Nicholas Carlini, a research scientist at DeepMind, discussing his views on AI and his work in AI security. Key points include:</p>
                    <ul>
                      <li>Carlini wrote a viral blog post "How I Use AI" detailing practical ways he uses AI tools in his daily work as a security researcher. He emphasizes focusing on what AI can do for individuals rather than trying to have a universal answer.</li>
                      <li>He created a domain-specific language for writing personalized LLM benchmarks, arguing that more people should make benchmarks tailored to their specific needs rather than relying solely on standardized tests.</li>
                      <li>Carlini discusses his research in AI security, including work on data poisoning, model stealing, and extracting training data from language models. He emphasizes the importance of studying real-world vulnerabilities in AI systems.</li>
                      <li>He explains his preference for focusing on attacking rather than defending AI systems, stating that he finds it more motivating and believes he can contribute more effectively by identifying vulnerabilities.</li>

                    <h3>Is finetuning GPT4o worth it? — with Alistair Pullen, Cosine (Genie)</h3>
                    <p>This article discusses an interview with Alistair Pullen, CEO and co-founder of Cosine, about their new AI coding agent called Genie. Key points include:</p>
                    <ul>
                      <li>Genie achieved state-of-the-art results on the SWE-Bench coding benchmark, outperforming other solutions by a significant margin.</li>
                      <li>Cosine worked closely with OpenAI to fine-tune GPT-4 on billions of tokens of synthetic code data, focusing on reproducing the process of how human software engineers work rather than just training on finished code.</li>
                      <li>Genie uses a four-stage workflow: finding files, planning actions, writing code, and running tests. It can interact with GitHub and CI systems to execute and test code changes.</li>
                      <li>The team faced challenges in areas like code retrieval, context window limitations, and balancing different programming languages in the training data.</li>
                      <li>Cosine is looking to expand Genie's capabilities, increase their dataset size, and potentially customize models for specific customers' codebases.</li>
                    </ul>
